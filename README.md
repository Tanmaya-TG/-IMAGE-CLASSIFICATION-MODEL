*DESCRIPTION* : I build a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classfication using tensorflow on CIFAR-10 dataset which is an open source dataset. With CNN, at the end 20 epochs, accuracy was at around 90% which is a significant. CNN's are best for image classification and gives superb accuracy. Also computation is much less compared to simple ANN as maxpooling reduces the image dimensions while still preserving the features.
